# yaml-routes

## 0.3.3

### Minor Changes

-   Add unscoped CLI alias package and synchronize versions

    This adds a new 'yaml-routes' package that serves as an unscoped alias for '@yaml-routes/tanstack'. Users can now run 'npx yaml-routes' instead of 'npx @yaml-routes/tanstack' for convenience.

    Both packages are now linked to maintain synchronized versions.

### Patch Changes

-   Updated dependencies
    -   @yaml-routes/tanstack@0.4.0
